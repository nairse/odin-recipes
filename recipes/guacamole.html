        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Guacamole has always been one of my favorite
         dishes to prepare. It's quick, it's easy and 
         only requires a handful of ingredients.
         I loved my recipe but it was not until my SO
         created her own version of it that I realised mine
        wasn't so good afterall. Her recipe was way simpler
        and required even lesser ingredients. Follow along
        if you want to prepare the best homemade guac
        that you ever tasted!</p>
